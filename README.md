# IoT Weather Station â€“ Course Project

This repository contains the course project for the *Microcontrollers (Part 1)* course at **Lviv Polytechnic National University**.  
The project is developed by second-year student specializing in **Computer Science, Systems Engineering (Internet of Things)**.

## Project Overview  
This IoT-based weather station is built using:  

- **ESP32** as the main microcontroller  
- **DHT22** for temperature and humidity measurement  
- **LCD 1602** for real-time data display  
- **Client-server architecture** for data communication  

Additional features and components may be added in the future as the project evolves.
